<h1><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duboviy/web/master/logo.png" height=85 alt="logo" title="logo"> django-employer-department</h1>
Very simple webserver with basic REST API interface, admin panel and few tables:

Employees:
- id
- first name,
- last name,
- department_id

Departments:
- id,
- name

Admin panel allows to add/update/delete and search these tables.

An API interface on top of Django, where the results are in JSON format:
- get_users - returns a list of the users, with their department name
- get_user - receives as key the user's ID, and returns the user with it's department name.
